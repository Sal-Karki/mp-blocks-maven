**Authors**

* Samuel A. Rebelsky (starter code).
* Leonardo Alves Nunes
* Sal Karki

**Notes for the reader**

This project explores several uses of ASCII to create patterns. By using concepts of OOP in Java, you can combine several methods to create images.
By running Art80x24.java in the main folder you can see an art of a car done with different blocks implemented in this project.
